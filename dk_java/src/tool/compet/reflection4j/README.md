# Reflection for Java

This package is used for reflecting constant of a class, field, method.

NOTE: When use reflection, we need take care much about code optimization by
Pro-Guard since it will optimize on our code, for eg, maybe remove unused fields,
methods that will make reflection does not work as expected.
